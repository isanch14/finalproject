      Poco Bueno Ranch History
    </h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      Our ranch was established 20 years ago with the primary goal to save abused and neglected horses.
    </p><br>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      To Date, we have rescued and rehomed over 200 horses that would have been sold to a slaughterhouse. 
      The horse that started our journey, which we still own today along with her son and granddaughter is named Tango. 
      Tango was being sold to a slaughterhouse, because her owners were angry that they could not get her to behave. 
      After we purchased her, brought her home, she has been an absolute dream horse. 
    </p><br>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      My daughter, Sarah, at 9 years old began training Tango for barrel racing and roping events, which Tango excelled in everything becoming an all-around Rodeo horse. 
      Over 100 people have learned how to ride on Tango. Everyone from small children, older people, veterans and kids with special needs. 
      Tango has made such a difference in our lives and other people have had the opportunity to have interacted with this amazing horse.  
    </p><br>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      Here at Poco Bueno Ranch, we provide the opportunity to learn about western riding for all ageâ€™s year round. 
      Additional lessons include learning about barrel racing and roping as the learner progresses with riding lessons. 
      There are other opportunities to learn how to properly train, maintain, and manage a horse.
